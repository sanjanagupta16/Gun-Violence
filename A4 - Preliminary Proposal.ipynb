    "Over 37,500 American lives are lost on an average every year due to gun related violence. Between 1968 to 2011, about 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the United States. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides and accidental discharges. The US gun homicide rate is 25 times than that of other high income countries. (!!) \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the alarming trend at which homicidal shootings have been increasing, it's important to take a hard look at this problem and, and ultimately make **data-driven** decisions. Unfortunately, research into firearms and gun control is full of difficulties due to limited data on gun ownership and use and aggregation of crime data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to explore this issue and to see if there exists a correlation between gun related crimes and the firearm laws mandated by each state. This project also wishes to explore the different socio-economic and/or demographic factors that lead to higher number of such incidents."

It is a comprehensive record of over 260K gun violence related incidents in the United States from 2013-2018. This data was web scraped from [Gun Violence Archive](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/), a not-for-profit corporation that collects gun violence related incidents from over 7,500 law enforcement, media, government, and commercial sources daily.\n",

    "* Casualties (Killed, Injured)\n",
