# DATA 512 Au 20: Human-Centered Data Science

## Final Project Preliminary Proposal

### Project Proposal
This project aims to explore gun violence related crimes in the United States and to investigate if there are any significant socio-economic and/or demographic factors that lead to these crimes.

### Data
The data that will be primarily used is the [Gun Violence Data](https://www.kaggle.com/jameslko/gun-violence-data) hosted on Kaggle. It is a comprehensive record of over 260K gun violence related incidents in the United States from 2013-2018. This data was collected by [Gun Violence Archive](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/), a not-for-profit corporation that collects gun violence related incidents from over 7,500 law enforcement, media, government, and commercial sources daily.
