    "Over 37,500 American lives are lost on an average every year due to gun related violence. Between 1968 to 2011, about 1.4 million people have died from firearms in the United States. This number includes all deaths resulting from a firearm, including suicides, homicides and accidental discharges. The US gun homicide rate is 25 times than that of other high income countries. (!!) \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the alarming trend at which homicidal shootings have been increasing, it's important to take a hard look at this problem and, and ultimately make **data-driven** decisions. Unfortunately, research into firearms and gun control is full of difficulties due to limited data on gun ownership and use and aggregation of crime data.\n",

    "The purpose of this project is to explore this issue and to see if there exists a correlation between gun related crimes and the firearm laws mandated by each state. This project also wishes to explore the different socio-economic and/or demographic factors that lead to higher number of such incidents."

It is a comprehensive record of over 260K gun violence related incidents in the United States from 2013-2018.

    "Unfortunately, the Congress has prohibited [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/firearms/funded-research.html) from conducting any research on gun violence prevention and there has been no funding alloted for the same since 1996. Gun politics tends to be polarized in the United States between advocates of gun rights (typically conservatives) and those who support stricter gun laws (typically liberals). Since there are no gun laws at the federal level, it's hard to regulate the sale of firearms. Most states guarantee the [right to bear arms](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-2/), but laws vary from county to county as well. These laws are complex and due to lack of funding, there isn't a single source of rich data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been research carried out independently by various organizations that aim to build awareness about this issue. In particular, the [Everytown Support Fund](https://everytownsupportfund.org/) seeks to improve the understanding of the causes of gun violence and help reduce it. This is done by carrying out research, developing evidence based policies, and advancing gun safety and gun violence prevention in communities and courts. The [research](https://everytownresearch.org/research/) carried out by Everytown also lists solutions to deal with prevalent problem - [Stricter Background Checks](https://everytownresearch.org/solution/background-checks/), [Extreme Risk Laws\\Red Flags to de-escalate emergency situations](https://everytownresearch.org/solution/extreme-risk-laws/), [Secure and Responsible Gun Storage](https://everytownresearch.org/solution/responsible-gun-storage/), [Enforcing a Waiting Period](https://everytownresearch.org/solution/waiting-periods/) among a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting study carried out by the [American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/pubs/info/reports/gun-violence-prevention) aims to predict gun violence based on socio-economic and demographic information to identify at risk individuals, and preventing it at an individual level as well as at a community level."
